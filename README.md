# Docker & Openshift workshop

In this hands-on workshop you will learn how to:

* Install Docker on a Linux system
* Learn the basics of Docker (searching for images, running containers, building images, publishing images,...) 
* Creating your own images, turn them into containers and push them to your own registry.
* Setup an Openshift cluster to manage containerized applications.
* Deploy, scale and update applications in Openshift.

## Prerequisites

As we will be using Linux systems from the public cloud ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)), the only requirement is access to an SSH terminal:

* Windows: please download and install Putty from [here](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)
* Mac/Linux: an SSH terminal is preinstalled on your system
