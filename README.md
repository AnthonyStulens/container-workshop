# Docker & Openshift workshop

In this hands-on workshop you will learn how to:

* Install Docker on a Linux system
* Learn the basics of Docker (searching for images, running containers, building images, publishing images,...) 
* Create your own images, turn them into containers and push them to the Docker Hub registry.
* Setup your own containerized Openshift cluster to manage other containerized applications.
* Deploy, scale and update a Github webhook application on Openshift.
* Join a non-containerized multi-instance Openshift Origin Cluster on AWS.

## Prerequisites

As we will be using Linux systems from the public cloud ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)), the only requirement is access to an SSH terminal:

* Windows: please download and install Putty from [here](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html).
* Mac/Linux: an SSH terminal is preinstalled on your system.
